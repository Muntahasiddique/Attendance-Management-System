## Usage Guide

### First-Time Setup

1. **Create Admin Account**
   - Navigate to `/login`
   - Register as admin (first user becomes admin)

2. **Add Classes**
   - Login as admin
   - Go to "Manage" → "Classes"
   - Create classes with semester and section

3. **Add Courses**
   - Go to "Manage" → "Courses"
   - Assign courses to classes and teachers

4. **Enroll Students**
   - Go to "Enrollment" page
   - Fill student details and upload face images
   - System will extract face descriptors automatically

### Marking Attendance

1. **Configure Camera Settings**
   - Go to "Settings" page
   - Select camera type (Webcam/USB/IP Camera)
   - For IP Camera: Enter RTSP URL (e.g., `rtsp://192.168.0.103:554/stream`)
   - Adjust recognition settings (threshold, input size)

2. **Start Recognition**
   - Go to "Terminal" page
   - Select class and course
   - Click "Start Recognition"
   - Students will be automatically marked when detected

3. **View Reports**
   - Go to "Reports" page
   - Filter by date, class, course, or status
   - Export or analyze attendance data

## Configuration

### Recognition Settings

- **Matching Threshold** (0.5 - 0.95)
  - Lower = More lenient (may allow false positives)
  - Higher = Stricter (may reject valid faces)
  - Recommended: 0.70 - 0.80

- **Input Size** (224, 320, 416, 512)
  - Lower = Faster but less accurate
  - Higher = Slower but more accurate
  - Recommended: 416px

- **Detection Model**
  - Tiny Face Detector: Faster, good for real-time
  - SSD MobileNet v1: More accurate, slower

### Camera Types

- **Webcam**: Built-in or USB webcam
- **USB Camera**: External USB camera
- **IP Camera**: Network camera with RTSP support

### Time Settings

- **Work Start Time**: When attendance marking begins
- **Late Cutoff Time**: Time after which arrivals are marked "Late"
- **Work End Time**: When attendance marking ends
- **Timezone**: Local timezone for accurate time tracking

## Performance Optimization

The system includes several optimizations:

- **Database Indexes**: Optimized queries for fast data retrieval
- **Query Limits**: Prevents loading excessive records
- **Lean Queries**: Reduced memory usage for read operations
- **Reduced Detection Frequency**: 5 FPS (200ms intervals) for better CPU usage
- **Optimized Video Streaming**: Balanced quality and performance

## Troubleshooting

### Camera Not Working
- Check camera permissions in browser
- Verify RTSP URL format for IP cameras
- Test camera connection in Settings page
- Check FFmpeg installation for IP cameras

### Face Not Detected
- Ensure good lighting conditions
- Position face closer to camera
- Adjust input size in settings (try 512px)
- Lower matching threshold for more lenient detection

### Slow Performance
- Reduce input size to 320px or 224px
- Use Tiny Face Detector instead of SSD MobileNet
- Close other applications using camera
- Check system CPU usage

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify MongoDB is running
- Check MONGODB_URI in .env file
- Ensure MongoDB version compatibility

## Security

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- CSRF protection (recommended to add)
- Input validation and sanitization
